    <p><strong>Brief Biography</strong></p>
    <p>Jakub Kris Rucinski, born on July in Olsztyn, Poland, was the third child of his father and the only son. From an early age, he showed a keen interest in books and computers, spending much of his childhood reading fantasy novels, drawing, writing stories, and playing strategy games.</p>
    <p>On April 3rd, 2022, Jakub obtained the ‘go ahead’ from Book Depository to release his debut novel <strong>‘Paradigm Shift’</strong> on all platforms. Since then, he secured deals with Amazon and Barnes & Noble to have the book published and shipped to over twenty countries. Jakub’s neo-traditionalist style is inspired by the struggles of his youth and explores philosophical concepts of absurdism and self-discovery. His work, including his initial publications and other subsequent titles, has been widely admired and sold worldwide. On October 16th of the same year, Jakub released a thriller novella on the topic of masculine spirituality entitled <strong>‘No Brakes’</strong> in collaboration with award-winning film director and journalist Jamie Stangroom.</p>
    <p>Jakub Rucinski was born in Olsztyn, lived all over Europe and the United States, has largely Polish but some Romani (gypsy) heritage, and is a well-renowned thriller author. While in high school in South Florida, he competed in a Speech and Debate tournament named FCDI on the state level, placed fourth in the state in impromptu speaking, and met Governor Ron DeSantis, with whom he discussed his books.</p>
